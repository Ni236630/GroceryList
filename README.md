# GroceryList

GroceryList is an application develeoped for those who cook, but whose schedule is too busy to spend hours going through recipes and their cabinets to make a grocery list for the week. GroceryList provides a space for a user to input their favorite recipes then quickly and easily generate a grocery list for the week. The user can review both the recipes and grocery lists and delete either if desired.

## Resources

### DB Diagram

For creating an ERD I used DB Diagram. This was the go to tool to create my ERD structure that I would use for my JSON "database". This web app was easy to use. 

For more information, check out [DB Diagram](https://www.dbdiagram.io/home)

### Miro

I used Miro to efficiently develop the wireframe of this application. Miro's wireframing tools helped quickly put my ideas on "paper" so that I could see a rough draft before starting.

### React

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
